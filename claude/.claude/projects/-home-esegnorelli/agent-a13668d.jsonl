I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans.\n\nI'm currently in a READ-ONLY planning mode, which means I can:\n\n✓ **Explore your codebase** using tools like:\n  - `Read` - to examine file contents\n  - `Glob` - to find files matching patterns\n  - `Grep` - to search for code patterns\n  - `Bash` - for read-only operations (ls, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n✓ **Design implementation plans** including:\n  - Architecture analysis\n  - Step-by-step strategies\n  - Identifying critical files\n  - Following existing patterns\n\n✗ **I cannot modify files** - no Write, Edit, or file creation operations\n\nI'm ready when you are! Please share:\n1. **Your requirements** - What would you like to build or change?\n2. **Any specific perspective** - How would you like me to approach the design? (e.g., focus on performance, maintainability, security, etc.)\n3. **Relevant context** - Any files or areas of the codebase I should start exploring?\n\nWhat would you like to work on today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":864,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWnyDbsQ78e2qu6emiwJm","type":"assistant","uuid":"0df3744b-ee9a-4ae4-af63-bbd77122b5dd","timestamp":"2026-01-04T20:29:20.752Z"}
